  <h1>Liana Configuration</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    <strong>Liana</strong> is a lightweight, framework-agnostic Java configuration
    library designed for clarity, predictability, and extensibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modern Java applications often need to load configuration from multiple
    sources, formats, and environments. Existing solutions tend to be either
    tightly coupled to a framework or overly complex for simple use cases.
  </p>

  <p>
    Liana provides a <strong>deterministic configuration resolution pipeline</strong>
    with sensible defaults, while allowing you to extend every step when needed.
    It adapts to your application — not the other way around.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Liana?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Framework-agnostic:</strong> works in plain Java, microservices,
      CLI tools, and any JVM-based environment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-format support:</strong> load and merge configuration from
      properties, YAML, JSON, and XML out of the box.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Predictable overrides:</strong> later resources override earlier
      ones, making environment layering explicit and safe.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deep placeholder interpolation:</strong> resolve variables across
      nested structures with support for defaults.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Type-safe access:</strong> read values as primitives, collections,
      maps, or strongly-typed POJOs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Immutable and thread-safe:</strong> configuration is read-only
      after loading.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Designed for Extension</h2>

  <p>
    Liana is built around a small set of well-defined abstractions:
    <em>providers</em>, <em>loaders</em>, and a resolution pipeline.
    This makes it easy to introduce custom configuration sources
    (filesystem, HTTP, secrets managers) or new file formats without
    changing the core.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can mix multiple providers in the same configuration load and even
    assign a specific provider per resource when needed.
  </p>

  <h2>What Liana Is — and Is Not</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>✔ Liana is</strong> a focused configuration library with explicit
      behavior and minimal magic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>✘ Liana is not</strong> a full application framework or a
      dependency injection container.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>✔ Liana complements</strong> frameworks like Spring, Micronaut,
      or Quarkus when you want more control over configuration resolution.
    </li>
  </ul>
